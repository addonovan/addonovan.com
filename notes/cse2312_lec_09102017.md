Pipeline hazards
===

A pipeline hazard is anything that can cause the pipeline to stall.

1. Structural hazards
---
These won't generally be covered in our class, as they are impossible to know
without specifically looking at a certain device's hardware capabilities.

A structural hazard occurs when the hardware a program is running on doesn't
support the certain conditions under which instructions are being performed.

For example:  
(note: this is made up and isn't valid ARMv7 syntax, nor is it true for the
Raspberry Pi)
If the hardware doesn't allow for simulatenous reads and writes to register file for
unreleated registers.

```arm7
str r1, [r2]
ldr r3, [r4]
```

If the given conditions are true, then this would cause a stall, becuase the
pipeline doesn't support reading from r3 while writing to r1 at the same time.



2. Data Hazards
--- 
These occur when there's a depenedency between instructions in the pipeline.

```arm7
add r1, r2, r3
sub r5, r4, r1
```

If we plot this in a chart, we can see why this causes a stall.

Idealy, this would be the pipeline with only these two instructions:
```
| add |  IF |  ID |  EX | MEM |  WB |     |
| sub |     |  IF |  ID |  EX | MEM |  WB |
```

However, because the `ID` stage also fetches the related register values, there
will be a stall in the `sub`'s `ID` stage. The `sub` instruction can't fetch
the value of `r1` until the value of `r1` has been updated, which happens only
*after* `add`'s `WB` stage. So realistically this will happen:
```
| add |  IF |  ID |  EX | MEM |  WB |     |     |     |     |
| sub |     |  IF |  ID | NOP | NOP | NOP |  EX | MEM |  WB |
```
Where NOP is short for "No Operation" (i.e. the pipeline stalls in its current
stage, doing nothing)

The number of `NOP`s present in this diagram correlates to how many time
periods the pipeline has stalled.

It's important to know that instructions following a stall do not contribute to
the stall, they are simply delayed *by* the stall.
E.g.:
```
| add |  IF |  ID |  EX | MEM |  WB |     |     |     |     |     |
| sub |     |  IF |  ID | NOP | NOP | NOP |  EX | MEM |  WB |     |
| lsr |     |     |  IF | NOP | NOP | NOP |  ID |  EX | MEM |  WB |
```
There is still a stall of 3 time units in this, despite the `NOP`s from the `lsr`
because the `lsr` is delayed because of the stall from the `sub`, but it isn't
part of the stall itself.

Solutions for data hazards:
1) Let it stall (easiest)
2) Forwarding
   * The new value of `r1` was actually calculated in the `EX` stage, so
     forwarding would be chip support for "hey, we just calculated this on the
     ALU, you can have the value before we write it to the register"
   * Forwarding is built into the hardware and may not always be available,
     so there's nothing we as programmers can do
3) Reorder instructions
   * Assemblers/compilers might do this for you, but this is how this homework
     assignment will be handled.

## Reordering instructions:
If we had three unrelated instructions between the `add` and `sub` from the
code before, then we could avoid the stall entirely, for instance:
```arm7
add r1, r2, r3
lsr r6, #2
lsl r7, #3
mvn r3
sub r5, r4, r1
```

We would get this chart:
| add |  IF |  ID |  EX | MEM |  WB |     |     |     |    |
| lsr |     |  IF |  ID |  EX | MEM |  WB |     |     |    |
| lsl |     |     |  IF |  ID |  EX | MEM |  WB |     |    |
| mvn |     |     |     |  IF |  ID |  EX | MEM | WB  |    |
| sub |     |     |     |     |  IF |  ID |  EX | MEM | WB |
Now the `ID` stage of the `sub` is after the `WB` stage of the `add`, so
there will be no stall.


3. Control Hazards
---
Caused when the CPU doesn't know which instruction should be executed next.
I think it's easier to see visually what happens. The null spaces between `bgt`
and `add` towards the end are the stalls caused by the control hazard.

Solutions for control hazards:
1) Let it stall
2) branch prediction (CPU side, has become quite good)
3) Reorder independent code
4) Branch less often

3 &amp; 4 are what we'll use in class, as we can actually do those from the
software side.
