This mod was originally a simple standalone mod which allowed the player to reduce his or her infamy, in exchange for a lumpsum of cash, jokingly named after the Correct The Record campaign run by Hillary Clinton's campaign team in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election."

            p.note < "While this certainly doesn't make an awful lot of sense, and definitely didn't wasn't the outcome of the actual Correct The Record campaign, this mod was intended to be fun, not difficult."

            p < "So, in total, a country which runs a correct the record campaign will lose 12.4 more infamy than normal through the course of a year, which is essentially an entire conquest casus belli!"
            p.note < "Yes, this means it's op, no, I probably won't nerf the immediate effects very much. I will, however, add in events which can increase tensions between those correcting the record and those not, or events which will have your campaign be detected."

A country will only be able to be partitioned if the war is a complete blowout, and it no longer controls any of its territories. The idea for this came from the WWII-era, where both Poland and Germany were partitioned within the war."

            p < "To take the partition decision, you must meet the following conditions:"

            p < "The partition state/colony wargoals will not need to be justified, as they will have already been justified against the given country, as a result of your declaration of their partition. These wargoals will allow you to acquire *any* state or colony of theirs (even the capital), at 10% of their original warscore, which puts every province within reach. Admittedly, I haven't tested against every country; however, it worked on Russia, so it should be able to work on pretty much everyone."
