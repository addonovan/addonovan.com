A common frustration when trying to play multiplayer games is mismatched checksums, with no indication as to what, *exactly* is different between the players; this tool will allow players to see the folders (and individual files) which are different."

                "The cheksum displayed next to the files are the first 6 characters of the [md5](#why-md5) checksum, but the full hashcode can be seen when the file or folder is selected."

                "While md5 is no longer secure enough for use for security purposes, it's still okay to use in this scenario, as we're just checking if two files are the same, and the chances of two perfectly valid game files (with differing content) having the same checksum is extremely slim. Also, it was faster for me to use md5 than sha256."
