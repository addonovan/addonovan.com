                "It's very annoying to have to sit around for such extended periods of time, waiting for your infamy to run out, especially in multiplayer games. This mod addresses this by allowing the player (AIs excluded) to reduce his or her infamy by 15, by paying 14000&pound; (roughly the equivalent of 2 million USD today)."
