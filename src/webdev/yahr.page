            "YAHR is short for Yet Another HTML Replacement (naming is difficult), and is the most obvious change when using webdev. YAHR shortens what is required to write a webpage and allows you to use css selectors, like `#id` and `.class`, when writing tags, instead of `id=...` or `class=...`, respectively."

                "The hierarchy of YAHR is exactly the same as HTML; except, YAHR uses indentation (four *spaces*) for embedding elements inside of each other instead of the `<tag>...</tag>` syntax that HTML uses. In addition to this, the `<DOCTYPE html>` and root `<html>` tags are implied in YARH and should never be written out. For example, the two following snippets are the same:"
                pre < code.html
                    "<DOCTYPE html>"
                    "<html>"
                    "   <head>"
                    "       <title> Hello world! </title>"
                    "   </head>"
                    "   <body>"
                    "       Hello world!"
                    "   </body>"
                    "</html>"

                    "       &quot;Hello world!&quot;"

            p
                "Rather than treating IDs and classes as attributes (as they are in HTML), YAHR has specific syntax for them. Following a tag with `#id` will set the tag's ID to be `id`, and `.class` will do the same for a class. This is the same syntax as css uses for selectors, which also helps to keep the definition and styling in synch."

            p
                "Attributes other than these have a separate syntax for setting, as shown below:"
                pre < code.yahr

                    "   size: &quot;12px&quot;"
                    "   color: &quot;red&quot;"
                "The attributes are children of the tag, and match the format *name: &quotvalue&quot;* similar to a rule in css (except the quotes are mandatory for all attributes)."

            p
                "YAHR supports inling attributes and elements into a single line, under certain conditions. If there is only one attribute, the definition can be put immediately after the tag's name (and id or classes when they are there) inside a set of parentheses. If there is only one child tag, then the child may be inlined by following the tag with a <, then writing the rest of the tag. These can be extremely use when embedding many simple elements inside each other (e.g. text inside an *a* inside an *li*)."

Because it's *meme*ingful (actually, I put it in as a joke and didn't want to change it). If this is at the *beginning* of a line, then the line (and all of its children) are completely ignored."
