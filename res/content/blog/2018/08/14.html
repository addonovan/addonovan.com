        Hey, I finally got the blog feature to work, how neat is that! It's not
        as robust as I had originally planned for, but it's still a cool
        feature. (It's also the slowest part of my website at the time of
        writing this, at about twice the duration as the static home and
        projects pages!)

        It's a pretty nifty little thing, but it really could be a whole lot
        better; luckily, I am planning on improving it, just figured I might
        ought to get <i>something</i> done with it before worrying about the
        finer things.

    <h3>The <code>PageBuilder</code></h3>
    <p>
        One of the biggest refactors I did was creating the
        <code>PageTemplate</code> and <code>PageBuilder</code> structs which
        have <i>greatly</i> simplified the control flow of all of the
        controllers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's start with the <code>PageBuilder</code>, because it came first.
        This is essentially just a tri-state <code>Result</code> containing the
        states listed below.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><code>Ok(&lt;Arc&lt;String&gt;&gt;)</code></li>
        <li><code>NotFound</code></li>
        <li><code>InternalServerError(&lt;ControllerError&gt;)</code></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        If you know your HTTP codes, you should realize that these correspond
        with 200, 404, and 500, respectively. The goal of this was to be able
        to apply different actions to the page based on its current state,
        (e.g. if we couldn't load a file's contents, then the page will switch
        to the <code>NotFound</code> state and will skip any actions that should
        be performed on the other states.) and only its current state.

        This alleviated a lot of problems with matching and having to do early
        returns all over the place to avoid accidentally messing with, e.g., the
        404 page.

    <h3>The <code>PageTemplate</code></h3>
    <p>
        Next, I wanted to format my pages differently with different
        controllers, but this wasn't as simple as it seemed at the time. I was
        directly embedding the parameters which could be passed to the page
        inside the <code>PageBuilder</code> itself, so I needed to refactor a
        bit to get this template outside and editable. Enter the
        <code>PageTemplate</code>, which is basically just a fancy way to tell
        the builder "hey, run Handlebars using this serializable struct with
        data."
    </p>
<pre lang="rust">
pub trait PageTemplate {

    const NAME: &'static str;

    type TemplateData: Serialize;

    fn data(
        self,
        body: Arc&lt;String&gt;,
        cache: &mut MutexGuard&lt;Cache&gt;
    ) -> Result&lt;Self::TemplateData&gt;

}
</pre>
    <p>
        Here, the <code>NAME</code> refers the name of the corresponding
        template file in the res/ directory, and <code>TemplateData</code> is
        the struct of parameters that will be passed to that template.
        Interestingly, the current <code>body</code> of the response must be
        passed so that the template can transform it if needed, and the lock
        on the global <code>cache</code> must also be passed in case the
        template needs to access any data from it.
    </p>
    <p>
        This, combined with the <code>PageBuilder</code> was actually able to
        make development of the site much easier, as you can stitch together
        templates easily and not have to worry about how they interact. It's a
        bit slower than it was before, as the page outputs are no longer cached
        when applicable, but I'm intending to get back to that point.
    </p>

    <h3>The Blog</h3>
    <p>
        I know you were just dying to find out how I actually implemented the
        blog, weren't you? Well, currently I have a <code>posts.json</code> file
        of the following format which just describes all of the posts in the
        blog in reverse-chronological order. This file is read and parsed when
        the webserver starts up and templates are generated right then for all
        blog posts.
    </p>
<pre lang="json">
[
    {"year": ..., "month": ..., "day": ..., "title": ...},
    ...
]
</pre>
    <p>
        When a request is made, the controller will pull the year, month, and
        day from the URL, then match it to an entry and return a copy of that
        template. This is then used to fill in the blog post template with
        general blog-y stuff like:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Title</li>
        <li>Date</li>
        <li>Content</li>
        <li>Previous post</li>
        <li>Next post</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        And then the output from that is just the body of the site, so it has
        to be run through the site's main template for the outer formatting
        which is on all of the domain's pages.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a slight problem with this set-up at the moment:<br/>
        Adding a new blog post requires the server to be restarted, which is a
        bit weird and overkill, but I can live with it for now.
