            Hey, that's this website! Yes, I designed this website and the server
            that's running it! It runs on the <code>actix-web</code> framework
            in Rust, and it's pretty nifty, in my opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
            A neat thing is the <a href="/cache_overview">caching</a> system I
            designed for the site, to minimize the number of times the site goes
            to the disk. It's not really all that important, considering the
            size of the site, but it's pretty neat! I plan to extend the cache
            to include the output of the templating engine (to prevent running
            it unnecessarily) and to phase out the oldest items when the cache
            gets big <sup>[1]</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <sup>[1]</sup> Yes, I realize it doesn't actually get big at the
            moment, it would be more of a fun exercise rather than actually
            being useful.

            A (limited) Arm7 interpreter written in JavaScript. This can
            simulate some basic instructions and display how the 32-bit
            registers act during the program execution, all while showing the
            current line being executed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Arm7 assembly is parsed before it is interpreted, by using a
            parser generated from a <code>PEG.js</code> grammar.

    <article> <h3>FAT32 Image Reader</h3>
        <p class="info">

        </p>
        <p>
            This was a school assignment for my undergraduate Operating Systems
            class in Spring 2018. The program will mount a FAT32 file system
            image and drops you into an interactive command-line shell which
            will let you interact with the file system (reads only).
        </p>
        <p>
            The assignment comes with an implementation of a custom memory
            allocator which tracks when blocks are allocated and freed when in
            debug mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            To make sure each part of the program was working correctly, I wrote
            a unit testing system along with the program and practiced
            test-driven development for this project. The unit testing framework
            is pretty nice to use, and will run all unit tests under a separate
            process with a <code>SIGSEGV</code> handler attached to catch
            segfaults. Shared memory is also employed to keep track of the total
            number of assertions (and failures) throughout the program.

        <p>
            This was a school assignment for my undergraduate Software
            Engineering course in Spring 2018. We were tasked with specifying,
            writing, and testing a networked game of Blackjack which uses the
            <abbr title="Godforsaken C-with-classes library with awful docs">FLTK</abbr>
            library for the GUI and OpenSplice DDS for networked communication,
            both prescribed by the professor.
        </p>
        <p>
            The class was split into groups which either implemented the player
            or dealer parts of the program, which were required to communicate
            with eachother over the OpenSplice network. So this required a
            program which worked along with any of the other teams', without
            any direct communication between the teams.
        </p>
        <p>
            And, <abbr title="except I totally am">not to brag or anything</abbr>,
            but the professor said it was the
            <a href="/raw/projects/not_bragging.png">"best project code in years."</a>

            This is just a collection of other, smaller school projects which
            didn't really warrant their own repositories or mentions. There are
            some interesting assignments, as well as links to all other school
            projects which <i>were</i> interesting enough to have their own
            respositories.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the top-level repository doesn't contain any
            <code>README</code> information, each folder has information about
            the course, and each of the projects within it.

            This was a custom-made webframework that I was planning on using for
            my website (this one!), before I decided to go with actix-web
            instead. This was inspired by Gary Bernhardt's screencast on
            <a href="destroyallsoftware.com">Destroy All Software</a>. While I
            didn't end up using the framework, I did get a rough draft of this
            website done with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>README</code> on the github for this project is actually
            somewhat decent (i.e. it exists and isn't just &quot;TODO&quot;), so
            if you're interested in more details, be sure to check it out!

            This was a school assignment for my undergraduate Operatin Systems
            class in Spring 2018. The program is a simple UNIX-style shell, like
            <code>sh</code>.

            The program comes with following built-in commands:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>cd</code></li>
            <li><code>pwd</code> prints working directory</li>
            <li><code>history</code> shows previously run commands</li>
            <li><code>showpids</code> shows pids of previously run commands</li>
            <li><code>!n</code> runs the <code>nth</code> previous command</li>
        </ul>
